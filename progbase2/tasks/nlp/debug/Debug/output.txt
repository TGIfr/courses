My, God, 

“Yes, 
It, worked, 
It, was, fun, 
Little, noise, 

I, enjoyed, radios, 

“This, is, a, hotel, 
She’s, a, cute, girl, 
“I, don’t, know, how, 
Did, you, like, the, program, 

That’s, a, puzzle, drive, 

I, say, “I’m, thinking, 
So, it, makes, a, little, noise, 

So, I, got, a, fancy, reputation, 

Sometimes, it, took, quite, a, while, 

One, job, was, really, sensational, 

I, bought, radios, at, rummage, sales, 

I, think, to, myself, “What, the, hell, 

Two, seconds, later, bup, bup, he, comes, 
Once, I, get, on, a, puzzle, I, can’t, get, off, 

So, the, guy, says, “What, are, you, doing, 

I, went, up, to, the, radio, and, tried, to, fix, it, 

You, know, what, the, result, was, naturally, 
I, jumped, out, of, bed, yelling, “It, worked, 

“But, I’m, only, a, little, boy, ”, I, said, 
I, betcha, he, comes, and, saves, the, situation, 
Then, it, quieted, down, and, played, correctly, 
No, wonder, the, poor, guy, couldn’t, stand, it, 
That, was, easy, it, wasn’t, plugged, in, right, 
I, also, had, a, storage, battery, and, a, lamp, bank, 
So, I, started, to, think, “How, can, that, happen, 
But, I, was, often, in, the, house, fiddling, with, my, lab, 

The, next, radio, I, tried, to, fix, didn’t, work, at, all, 

The, main, reason, people, hired, me, was, the, Depression, 
On, the, way, I, say, “What’s, the, trouble, with, the, radio, 
The, sets, were, simple, the, circuits, were, not, complicated, 
I, got, a, series, of, lessons, of, ever, increasing, difficulty, 
We, understand, you, might, be, able, to, do, something, about, it, 
When, I, was, about, eleven, or, twelve, I, set, up, a, lab, in, my, house, 
How, do, you, know, about, radios—you’re, just, a, little, boy, 
I, shouldn’t, have, bitten, that, one, off, but, I, didn’t, know, 
He, went, off, and, filed, something, and, fixed, it, up, so, it, worked, 
Every, damn, crazy, conundrum, that, people, had, invented, I, knew, 

“Yes, we, know, that, but, we’d, like, you, to, come, over, anyway, 

But, when, we, got, there, I, went, over, to, the, radio, and, turned, it, on, 
So, I’d, climb, on, roofs, to, fix, antennas, and, all, kinds, of, stuff, 
I, can’t, just, leave, it, after, I’ve, found, out, so, much, about, it, 
We, have, a, radio, that, doesn’t, work, and, would, like, it, repaired, 
It, consisted, of, an, old, wooden, packing, box, that, I, put, shelves, in, 
”, I, finally, fixed, it, because, I, had, and, still, have, persistence, 
Well, I, was, small, so, any, screwdriver, looked, big, in, my, back, pocket, 

It, was, a, hotel, that, my, aunt, was, running, but, I, didn’t, know, that, 
You, come, to, fix, the, radio, but, you’re, only, walking, back, and, forth, 

One, day, I, got, a, telephone, call, “Mister, are, you, Richard, Feynman, 
Then, we, ran, upstairs, and, we, started, to, broadcast, “This, is, Uncle, Don, 

I, had, a, fuse, in, the, system, so, if, I, shorted, anything, the, fuse, would, blow, 
So, I, owned, up, to, what, it, was, that, I, could, hear, it, upstairs, the, hour, before, 
During, high, school, every, puzzle, that, was, known, to, man, must, have, come, to, me, 
”, Instead, they, were, saying, “Would, you, like, a, little, milk, or, some, cake, 
So, they, all, got, excited, about, this, and, I, predicted, a, couple, of, other, things, 
If, there, was, charcoal, on, one, of, the, resistors, you, knew, where, the, trouble, was, 

Then, she’d, go, away, and, come, back, with, another, one, and, I’d, always, know, it, 

“It, was, good, ”, she, said, “but, why, did, you, make, the, music, with, your, mouth, 
I, had, a, heater, and, I’d, put, in, fat, and, cook, french, fried, potatoes, all, the, time, 
I, have, to, keep, going, to, find, out, ultimately, what, is, the, matter, with, it, in, the, end, 
Newspapers, burn, fast, you, know, and, the, flame, looked, pretty, big, inside, the, room, 
Then, they, realized, that, there, must, be, some, trick, to, it—that, I, must, know, somehow, 
If, he, hasn’t, got, any, money, you’d, think, he, could, stand, a, little, noise, for, a, while, 
I, didn’t, know, it, at, the, time, but, I, think, it, was, the, type, of, telephone, he, originally, used, 
I, also, had, a, loudspeaker—not, the, whole, speaker, but, the, part, without, the, big, horn, on, it, 
The, thing, began, to, roar, and, wobble—WUH, BUH, BUH, BUH, BUH—A, tremendous, amount, of, noise, 
On, one, of, these, radios, one, night, I, got, WACO, in, Waco, Texas—it, was, tremendously, exciting, 

After, the, fire, was, out, I, took, the, magazine, off, but, now, the, room, began, to, fill, up, with, smoke, 
I, went, over, there, with—they, still, tell, the, story—a, big, screwdriver, in, my, back, pocket, 
As, the, repair, jobs, got, more, and, more, complicated, I, got, better, and, better, and, more, elaborate, 

On, this, same, tube, radio, up, in, my, lab, I, was, able, to, hear, a, station, up, in, Schenectady, called, WGN, 

He’s, putting, me, down, the, whole, way, and, I’m, thinking, “So, what’s, the, matter, with, him, 
It’s, what, accounts, for, my, wanting, to, decipher, Mayan, hieroglyphics, for, trying, to, open, safes, 
All, of, a, sudden, this, tremendous, bell, went, off, with, a, helluva, racket—BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, 
I, didn’t, get, to, do, as, much, as, I, wanted, to, because, my, mother, kept, putting, me, out, all, the, time, to, play, 
I, wouldn’t, stop, until, I, figured, the, damn, thing, out—it, would, take, me, fifteen, or, twenty, minutes, 

But, because, it, was, breezy, outside, the, wind, lit, the, fire, again, and, now, the, magazine, was, out, of, reach, 
But, during, the, day, other, guys, would, come, to, me, with, the, same, problem, and, I’d, do, it, for, them, in, a, flash, 
”, Then, I, said, to, myself, “All, right, take, the, tubes, out, and, reverse, the, order, completely, in, the, set, 

Radio, circuits, were, much, easier, to, understand, in, those, days, because, everything, was, out, in, the, open, 
So, for, one, guy, to, do, it, took, me, twenty, minutes, while, there, were, five, guys, who, thought, I, was, a, super, genius, 
So, I, discovered, that, the, speaker, could, act, like, a, microphone, and, you, didn’t, even, need, any, batteries, 

And, all, the, time, on, the, way, to, his, house, he’s, saying, things, like, “Do, you, know, anything, about, radios, 
And, when, the, RF, circuit’s, finally, going, and, the, grid, voltages, are, adjusted, everything’s, all, right, 
They, didn’t, have, any, money, to, fix, their, radios, and, they’d, hear, about, this, kid, who, would, do, it, for, less, 

One, day, my, cousin, Francis, and, I, sat, Joan, down, and, said, that, there, was, a, special, program, she, should, listen, to, 

One, day, I, was, playing, with, the, Ford, coil, punching, holes, in, paper, with, the, sparks, and, the, paper, caught, on, fire, 
Well, I, discovered, that, I, could, hear, this, program, up, in, my, lab, on, WGN, one, hour, before, it, was, broadcast, in, New, York, 
The, guy, is, obviously, poor—his, car, is, a, complete, wreck—and, we, go, to, his, house, which, is, in, a, cheap, part, of, town, 
(Many, radio, sets, in, those, days, used, the, same, tubes, in, different, places—212’s, I, think, they, were, or, 212, A’s, 
And, if, wax, had, been, dripping, from, the, condenser, it, was, too, hot, and, you, could, tell, that, the, condenser, was, burned, out, 
At, school, we, were, talking, about, Alexander, Graham, Bell, so, I, gave, a, demonstration, of, the, speaker, and, the, earphones, 

I, had, a, Ford, coil—a, spark, coil, from, an, automobile—and, I, had, the, spark, terminals, at, the, top, of, my, switchboard, 
By, making, different, combinations, of, switches—in, series, or, parallel—I, knew, I, could, get, different, voltages, 
I, remember, one, particular, time, when, it, took, the, whole, afternoon, to, find, a, burned, out, resistor, that, was, not, apparent, 
He, got, me, other, jobs, and, kept, telling, everybody, what, a, tremendous, genius, I, was, saying, “He, fixes, radios, by, thinking, 
When, the, door, to, my, room, opened, it, pushed, the, wire, against, the, battery, and, closed, the, circuit, and, the, bell, would, go, off, 
But, it, was, all, right, and, when, the, bulbs, were, in, series, all, half, lit, they, would, gloooooooooow, very, pretty—it, was, great, 
I, didn’t, have, any, money, but, it, wasn’t, very, expensive, they, were, old, broken, radios, and, I’d, buy, them, and, try, to, fix, them, 
That, particular, time, it, happened, to, be, a, friend, of, my, mother, so, I, had, time, there, was, nobody, on, my, back, saying, “What, are, you, doing, 
We, know, a, very, nice, little, girl, named, Joan, who, lives, on, New, Broadway;, she’s, got, a, birthday, coming—not, today, but, such, and, such, 
The, voltage, on, the, grids, was, always, about, one, and, a, half, or, two, volts, and, the, voltages, on, the, plates, were, one, hundred, or, two, hundred, DC, 

We, lived, at, that, time, in, a, big, house;, it, was, left, by, my, grandfather, to, his, children, and, they, didn’t, have, much, money, aside, from, the, house, 

About, that, time, I, invented, a, burglar, alarm, which, was, a, very, simple, minded, thing, it, was, just, a, big, battery, and, a, bell, connected, with, some, wire, 
Or, if, you, couldn’t, tell, what, was, the, matter, by, looking, at, it, you’d, test, it, with, your, voltmeter, and, see, whether, voltage, was, coming, through, 
”, The, whole, idea, of, thinking, to, fix, a, radio—a, little, boy, stops, and, thinks, and, figures, out, how, to, do, it—he, never, thought, that, was, possible, 
The, wastebasket, was, still, too, hot, to, handle, so, I, got, a, pair, of, pliers, carried, it, across, the, room, and, held, it, out, the, window, for, the, smoke, to, blow, out, 
So, it, wasn’t, hard, for, me, to, fix, a, radio, by, understanding, what, was, going, on, inside, noticing, that, something, wasn’t, working, right, and, fixing, it, 
It, wasn’t, very, accurate, but, it, was, good, enough, to, tell, whether, things, were, in, the, right, ballpark, at, different, connections, in, those, radio, sets, 
Soon, I, couldn’t, hold, it, any, more, because, it, was, burning, near, my, fingers, so, I, dropped, it, in, a, metal, wastebasket, which, had, a, lot, of, newspapers, in, it, 
I, started, with, a, crystal, set, that, I, bought, at, the, store, and, I, used, to, listen, to, it, at, night, in, bed, while, I, was, going, to, sleep, through, a, pair, of, earphones, 
Now, I, had, to, have, a, fuse, that, was, weaker, than, the, fuse, in, the, house, so, I, made, my, own, fuses, by, taking, tin, foil, and, wrapping, it, around, an, old, burnt, out, fuse, 

When, a, person, has, been, negative, to, you, and, then, you, do, something, like, that, they’re, usually, a, hundred, percent, the, other, way, kind, of, to, compensate, 
Then, I, went, out, of, my, room, closed, the, door, behind, me, and, said, to, my, mother, “I’m, going, out, to, play, ”, and, the, smoke, went, out, slowly, through, the, windows, 

To, build, the, lamp, bank, I, went, down, to, the, five, and, ten, and, got, some, sockets, you, can, screw, down, to, a, wooden, base, and, connected, them, with, pieces, of, bell, wire, 

He, says, “When, I, turn, it, on, it, makes, a, noise, and, after, a, while, the, noise, stops, and, everything’s, all, right, but, I, don’t, like, the, noise, at, the, beginning, 
I, would, put, a, Raytheon, RH, tube, which, had, argon, gas, in, it, across, the, terminals, and, the, spark, would, make, a, purple, glow, inside, the, vacuum—it, was, just, great, 
So, I, pulled, the, flaming, wastebasket, back, in, through, the, window, to, get, the, magazine, and, I, noticed, there, were, curtains, in, the, window—it, was, very, dangerous, 
I, remember, in, high, school, during, first, period, a, guy, would, come, to, me, with, a, puzzle, in, geometry, or, something, which, had, been, assigned, in, his, advanced, math, class, 

So, now, I, had, a, microphone, and, I, could, broadcast, from, upstairs, to, downstairs, and, from, downstairs, to, upstairs, using, the, amplifiers, of, my, rummage, sale, radios, 
Across, my, fuse, I, had, a, five, watt, bulb, so, when, my, fuse, blew, the, load, from, the, trickle, charger, that, was, always, charging, the, storage, battery, would, light, up, the, bulb, 

I, also, did, some, things, with, electric, motors, and, built, an, amplifier, for, a, photo, cell, that, I, bought, that, could, make, a, bell, ring, when, I, put, my, hand, in, front, of, the, cell, 
So, when, I, got, to, MIT, there, was, a, dance, and, one, of, the, seniors, had, his, girlfriend, there, and, she, knew, a, lot, of, puzzles, and, he, was, telling, her, that, I, was, pretty, good, at, them, 
If, my, mother’s, friend, had, said, “Never, mind, it’s, too, much, work, ”, I’d, have, blown, my, top, because, I, want, to, beat, this, damn, thing, as, long, as, I’ve, gone, this, far, 
Ultimately, I, got, some, job, like, converting, a, DC, set, into, an, AC, set, and, it, was, very, hard, to, keep, the, hum, from, going, through, the, system, and, I, didn’t, build, it, quite, right, 
Usually, they, were, broken, in, some, simple, minded, way—some, obvious, wire, was, hanging, loose, or, a, coil, was, broken, or, partly, unwound—so, I, could, get, some, of, them, going, 
I, was, working, at, the, time, for, a, printer, and, a, man, who, knew, that, printer, knew, I, was, trying, to, get, jobs, fixing, radios, so, he, sent, a, fellow, around, to, the, print, shop, to, pick, me, up, 

One, night, my, mother, and, father, came, home, from, a, night, out, and, very, very, quietly, so, as, not, to, disturb, the, child, opened, the, door, to, come, into, my, room, to, take, my, earphones, off, 
At, that, time, my, sister, Joan, who, was, nine, years, younger, than, I, was, must, have, been, about, two, or, three, and, there, was, a, guy, on, the, radio, called, Uncle, Don, that, she, liked, to, listen, to, 
It, was, a, very, large, wooden, house, and, I, would, run, wires, all, around, the, outside, and, had, plugs, in, all, the, rooms, so, I, could, always, listen, to, my, radios, which, were, upstairs, in, my, lab, 
When, my, mother, and, father, went, out, until, late, at, night, they, would, come, into, my, room, and, take, the, earphones, off—and, worry, about, what, was, going, into, my, head, while, I, was, asleep, 
), So, I, changed, the, tubes, around, stepped, to, the, front, of, the, radio, turned, the, thing, on, and, it’s, as, quiet, as, a, lamb, it, waits, until, it, heats, up, and, then, plays, perfectly—no, noise, 
Now, they, couldn’t, wait, for, the, regular, hour, They, all, had, to, sit, upstairs, in, my, lab, with, this, little, creaky, radio, for, half, an, hour, listening, to, the, Eno, Crime, Club, from, Schenectady, 
I, bought, myself, a, milliammeter, in, New, York, and, converted, it, into, a, voltmeter, that, had, different, scales, on, it, by, using, the, right, lengths, (which, I, calculated), of, very, fine, copper, wire, 
But, what, I, hadn’t, realized, was, that, a, bulb’s, resistance, depends, on, its, temperature, so, the, results, of, my, calculations, weren’t, the, same, as, the, stuff, that, came, out, of, the, circuit, 
After, you, took, the, set, apart, (it, was, a, big, problem, to, find, the, right, screws), you, could, see, this, was, a, resistor, that’s, a, condenser, here’s, a, this, there’s, a, that;, they, were, all, labeled, 

Well, I, got, the, magazine, put, the, fire, out, again, and, this, time, kept, the, magazine, with, me, while, I, shook, the, glowing, coals, out, of, the, wastepaper, basket, onto, the, street, two, or, three, floors, below, 
He’d, sing, little, songs, about, “good, children, ”, and, so, on, and, he’d, read, cards, sent, in, by, parents, telling, that, “Mary, So, and, so, is, having, a, birthday, this, Saturday, at, 25, Flatbush, Avenue, 
Now, all, of, us, kids—my, two, cousins, my, sister, and, the, neighborhood, kids—listened, on, the, radio, downstairs, to, a, program, called, the, Eno, Crime, Club—Eno, effervescent, salts—it, was, the, thing, 
I, didn’t, know, anything, about, it, but, there, was, also, a, handyman, at, the, hotel, and, either, he, noticed, or, I, noticed, a, loose, knob, on, the, rheostat—to, turn, up, the, volume—so, that, it, wasn’t, turning, the, shaft, 
”, We, sang, a, little, song, and, then, we, made, music, “Deedle, leet, deet, doodle, doodle, loot, doot;, deedle, deedle, leet, doodle, loot, doot, doo, We, went, through, the, whole, deal, and, then, we, came, downstairs, “How, was, it, 
So, I’d, discover, what, was, going, to, happen, and, then, when, we, were, all, sitting, around, the, radio, downstairs, listening, to, the, Eno, Crime, Club, I’d, say, “You, know, we, haven’t, heard, from, so, and, so, in, a, long, time, 
The, bulb, was, on, the, switchboard, behind, a, piece, of, brown, candy, paper, (it, looks, red, when, a, light’s, behind, it)—so, if, something, went, off, I’d, look, up, to, the, switchboard, and, there, would, be, a, big, red, spot, where, the, fuse, went, 

One, day, when, I, had, my, earphones, on, I, connected, them, to, the, loudspeaker, and, I, discovered, something, I, put, my, finger, in, the, speaker, and, I, could, hear, it, in, the, earphones;, I, scratched, the, speaker, and, I’d, hear, it, in, the, earphones, 
I, shut, the, door, so, my, mother—who, was, playing, bridge, with, some, friends, in, the, living, room—wouldn’t, find, out, there, was, a, fire, in, my, room, took, a, magazine, that, was, lying, nearby, and, put, it, over, the, wastebasket, to, smother, the, fire, 
So, during, the, dance, she, came, over, to, me, and, said, “They, say, you’re, a, smart, guy, so, here’s, one, for, you, A, man, has, eight, cords, of, wood, to, chop, …”
And, I, said, “He, starts, by, chopping, every, other, one, in, three, parts, ”, because, I, had, heard, that, one, 

I, start, walking, back, and, forth, thinking, and, I, realize, that, one, way, it, can, happen, is, that, the, tubes, are, heating, up, in, the, wrong, order—that, is, the, amplifier’s, all, hot, the, tubes, are, ready, to, go, and, there’s, nothing, feeding, in, or, there’s, some, back, circuit, feeding, in, or, something, wrong, in, the, beginning, part—the, HF, part—and, therefore, it’s, making, a, lot, of, noise, picking, up, something,
